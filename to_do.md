when we add a new cert from ui, there should be a test option before saving. so a bad url which doesnt work dont go in.. pls do that..

Days Until Expiry in the dashboard can change color if its close to expiry or breaching the threshold given.

if possilbe add a small tab inside the settings page to see the database schema and possibility to run select queries to view data in database via the same ui we have. accomodate it such a way that it looks like it belongs there.

think hard and well to make sure no existing features are impacted.
